Introduction
########################################################

Thank you for playing Story of a Lost Sky.

================================================================

Version 1.1.1B (Anime Expo 2016)

We've been working on some quality of life options, and now you are able to adjust the music and sound effects volume.
A new portrait of Wriggle Nightbug and one of the boss enemies Kotone  has been contributed by
MoldyKeyk. We also have a new character profiles page written from Aya's perspective of our big cast of characters.
Finally, a new mission Ch3Sq1 has been added involving Sakuya. It'll be available at the completion of Chapter 3.

There is still a lot to do in this project, so we intend to push forward this year to improve our game as best
as we can.

If you have the chance and would like to give us some feedback, a player survey has been set up here:

Thank you for joining us on this journey. We sincerely hope that you enjoy this game!
